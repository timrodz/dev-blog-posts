# Hacktoberfest: Let's build a VS Code Extension

Hi everyone! üëã

A few weeks ago, I started building a VS Code extension called [LightSwitch](https://github.com/timrodz/vscode-light_switch). It allows you to set-up two themes that swap around day & night. All you have to do is choose your themes and set your preferred times to switch them.

[PROJECT README](https://github.com/timrodz/vscode-light_switch).

Any stars are more than welcome ‚≠ê

Since we're in Hacktoberfest, building a tool together would be a great way to celebrate it (along with open source software)!

> Update: Issues #2, #3, #10, and #14 have received Pull Requests. Yay!

## Why? ü§î

Not so long ago, I started wearing prescription glasses, and thus I have been swapping between light/dark themes according to where/when I'm working.

_"Why not make a tool to automate this?!"_

This was the perfect reason to work on a small project that would teach me the API, workflows of VS Code, along with Typescript.

I must admit, creating an MVP was incredibly easy, and I encourage all fellow devs to [tinker with their own extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) ‚Äî¬†It's also a great way to get started with Typescript!

## The extension üöÄ

A basic implementation of LightSwitch is working, with the following features:

- Set themes to night and day
- Switch between night/day themes
- Switch themes according to a specific time

By collaborating in this project you will:

- Use Typescript to implement features, tests and fix bugs. Don't know the language? No worries! You can [learn Typescript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).
- Be exposed to API methods that will help you understand how extensions work. Discover the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api).
- Achieve your Hacktoberfest PRs (In case you need them).
- Work on a small Open Source project!

I' open to discussions of any kind. Any contribution is more than valid ‚ù§
