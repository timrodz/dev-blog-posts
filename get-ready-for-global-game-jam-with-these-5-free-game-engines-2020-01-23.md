# Get Ready For Global Game Jam With These 5 Free Game Engines

Hello there! 👋

Game development is a great way to improve your skills and even try new ones. It involves coding, art, music production, writing, testing, and many more areas! With the rise of its popularity, the number of tutorials and courses have been increasing, and thus decreasing the learning curve for those wanting to get into the industry.

An amazing way to get into making games is by doing **Game Jams**.

---

## What is a game jam? 💡

Simply put, Game Jams are hackathons where you make games (Board + Digital). Most of the usual hackathon rules apply: you're given a time limit, judges/participants can vote on excellence, and there might even be prizes. The best part though is that you get to work with great people to make awesome games!

### Great games can come out of game jams! 🚀

This is true! Whether it is [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/), [Ludum Dare](http://ldjam.com/), or even company in-house jams, some amazing games have come out from these!

Some examples include, but are (definitely) not limited to:

- [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com/play-prototype/).
- [Mini Metro](https://dinopoloclub.com/games/mini-metro/).
- [SCREENCHEAT](https://samuraipunk.com/screencheat).
- [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/).
- [Surgeon Simulator 2013](https://www.surgeonsim.com/).

## Great! Now, how I start making games? 🛠

## Introductory 🧰

Perfect if you're looking to get started with basic game development. No coding is required, and you get to only focus in the creation of games (No builds or similar hassles).

### Twine

Bitsy is a small game editor for creating **small, adventurous games**, created by independent game developer [Adam Le Doux](https://twitter.com/adamledoux).
